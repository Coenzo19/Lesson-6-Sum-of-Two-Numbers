// Write a function called `sum` that returns the sum of two numbers
function sum(a, b) {
  return a+b;
}

// Call the sum function (try doing this yourself!)
sum(12,5);

// After you've tried your function with different inputs, comment out any
// lines that print to the console in this file and run the tests!
